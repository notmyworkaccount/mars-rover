# mars-rover

This is my back end solution for retrieving pictures from the NASA Mars Rover website.  This solution will go out and get the picture information for a few "Earth Dates" and return the information along with an ID and Earth Date that the picture was taken.  To retrieve the picture pass in the ID and the Earth Date Taken back into the service to get the picture.

## Still Left TODO
- Wire up Poly retry pattern with NASA API
- Finish up unit tests
